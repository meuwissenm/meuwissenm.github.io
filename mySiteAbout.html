<h2>Outside of coding...</h2>

  <article>
    <p>I enjoy rare warm Minnesotan days either by taking my dog Sikko for walks around the nearby pond or by biking to nearby parks; during the winter if the snows good, I'll go snowboarding with my friends. The rest of my free time is spent either working, watching a sci fi movie or playing some video games, my latest favorite being Overwatch.</p>

    <h4>Cooking and coding</h4>
     <p>My other passion aside from coding is cooking. I think coding and cooking have a lot of similarities. Coordinating the stovetop, the kitchen equipment, and the oven trying to figure out when I should start cooking the different parts of my meal and what resources are going to to be used or shared feels like coordinating multi-threaded processes.</p>
    <p>When I repeat my favorite recipes I begin to understand them well enough that I can change my cooking methods to fit better with the meal I want to make and how to make each process more modular, it reminds me of the thinking process behind object oriented programming.</p>
    <p>And I also learned cleaning up while cooking frees up resources and makes it easier to clean up later, just like garbage collection in programming.</p>
    <p>Cooking and coding both take a lot of forethought and logic to coordinate the different moving parts and have all the parts turn out well.</p>

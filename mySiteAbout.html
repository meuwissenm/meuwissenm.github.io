<h2>Outside of coding...</h2>

  <article>
    <p>I enjoy rare warm Minnesotan days by disc golfing or by biking to nearby parks with my girlfriend. During the winter if the snows enough, I'll go snowboarding with my friends. The rest of my free time is spent either working, watching a sci fi movie, or playing some video games. My latest favorite being Super Mario Odyssey.</p>

    <h4>Cooking and coding</h4>
     <p>My other passion aside from coding is cooking. I think coding and cooking have a lot of similarities. Understanding basic methods and adapting them to different recipes I learn. Coordinating the stovetop, the kitchen equipment, and the oven trying to figure out when I should start cooking the different parts of my meal and what resources are going to to be used.</p>
    <p>When I become familiar with my favorite recipes, I begin to understand them well enough that I can change my cooking methods to fit better with the meal I want and perfect each process.</p>
    <p>And I also learned cleaning up while cooking frees up resources and makes it easier to clean up later.</p>
    <p>Cooking and coding both take a lot of forethought and logic to coordinate the different moving parts and have the result turn out as planned.</p>

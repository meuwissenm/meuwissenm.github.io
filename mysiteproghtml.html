  <h3>Projects:</h3>
  <h4>Context Search Chrome Extension</h4>
  <p>I really like the feature in google chrome that allows the user to search for a highlighted word in the google search engine, this is called a context search. I decided it would be cool to be able to search media sites that I use frequently such as Netflix and Google Music for the songs or movies I read about online. There are a lot of extensions that I can use to do this but I decided making it myself would be more lightweight, the results are below </p>

     <p>I learned that if I try to make more than one context menu item at once chrome will collapse them into one menu item, so I had to write the code below so different search engines will be submenus of the one context menu item.</p>

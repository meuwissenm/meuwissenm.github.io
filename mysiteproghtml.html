<h2>As a Programmer...</h2>
<p>
  I use a wide variety of languages to fulfill any requirements or task I need to resolve from server side php and SQL code, to application based java, c#, or c++, or even front end html, I know how to get most jobs done.
</p>
<h2>Projects:</h2>

<p>Student Registration Website for SILC:</p>
 <p>Working with a team in my Capstone class at Metropolitan State University, we created a fully functional website using HTML, CSS, and MySQL. We built the site to allow Administrators to add/remove users and classes, and we built functionality for students to login and sign up for classes.
</p>

<p>Yoga Website:</p>
<p>Worked with a team of students in my Internet Application Development class to create a website that allows admins to add/remove users and products, and functionality for users to login and buy products. This was developed using HTML, CSS, and SQL.
</p>

<p>Pedestrian Game:</p>
<p>Worked with another programmer to develop a game using Actionscript, meeting design requirements created by Menomonie Pedestrian Services to teach players about pedestrian laws.
